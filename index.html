    <p><strong>1. Why is JavaScript important in web development?</strong></p>
    <p>JavaScript is important in web development because it enables dynamic, interactive, and responsive features such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and asynchronous operations.</p>

    <p><strong>2. What is the difference between var, let, and const?</strong></p>
    <p>The difference between <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, and <code>const</code> is that <code>var</code> is function-scoped and hoisted with <code>undefined</code>, while <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> are block-scoped and hoisted without initialization, with <code>const</code> also preventing reassignment.</p>

    <p><strong>3. What happens if you try to use a variable before declaring it?</strong></p>
    <p>Using a variable before declaring it results in <code>undefined</code> for <code>var</code> but throws a <code>ReferenceError</code> for <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>.</p>
